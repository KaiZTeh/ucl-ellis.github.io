description: Marta Betcke is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University College London. She is also a member of Centre for Inverse Problems and Centre for Medical Image Computing. Between 2010 and 2013, she held an EPSRC Postdoctoral Research Fellowship "Image Reconstruction&#58 the Sparse Way" at UCL to investigate the implications of sparsity on image acquisition and reconstruction in different modalities. Before coming to UCL in the end of 2009, she was a PDRA in the School of Mathematics at the University of Manchester working on novel X-ray CT scanners for airport baggage screening. Hey interest is in broad areas of Inverse Problems, Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing. In particular in numerical solution of inverse problems, tomographic image reconstruction, compressed sensing, sparsity and compression, applied harmonic analysis and machine learning. She enjoys working on novel imaging technologies and their applications with focus on experimental design and reconstruction problem.
