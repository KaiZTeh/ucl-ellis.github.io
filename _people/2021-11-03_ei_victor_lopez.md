name: Victor Ponce Lopez
description: Victor is an Ellis member, a computer scientist, and a PhD research fellow in machine learning at the UCL Energy Institute. His current research focuses on recognizing patterns from multimodal data and has been applied in several domains and AI real-world problems - affective computing, e-health, Earth sciences, and currently in energy systems. He promotes deep learning and evolutionary computation to steer novel approaches for the benefit of society. His main research interests and expertise are transversal and multidisciplinary. He is a former scientific committee member of ChaLearn Looking At People, where he organised challenges and competitions in machine learning and affective computing. As a member of the ChaLearn organization, he worked in close collaboration with Prof. Isabelle Guyon, the co-inventor of the widely used method Support Vector Machines (SVM). He has been co-organiser of events at ICCV, ICMI, ECCV, ICPR, and CCIA conferences. He has participated in peer-reviewing processes for impact factor journals and conference proceedings in JMLR, IEEE TMultimedia, IEEE TPAMI, IET-CV, TTAC, ECCV, ICCV, CVPR, FG, in areas related to computer vision and machine learning with especial interest in behaviour analysis and social computing applications. He was awarded with the best national B.Sc. thesis in computer science in 2010, whose outcomes were published during the realisation of his interdisciplinary M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence. He has co-supervised and mentored 5+ students at different universities.
