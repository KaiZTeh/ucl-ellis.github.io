description: Carlo Ciliberto's research interests focus on foundational aspects of machine learning within the framework of statistical learning theory. He is particularly interested in the role of “structure” (being it in the form of prior knowledge or structural constraints) in reducing the sample complexity of learning algorithms with the goal of making them more sustainable both computationally and financially. He investigated these questions within the settings of structured prediction, multi-task and meta-learning, with applications to computer vision, robotics and recommendation systems.
