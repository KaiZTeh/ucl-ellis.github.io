title: Switching Linear Dynamical Systems for Condition Monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit
summary: <p>Abstract&#58;</p><p>Data drawn from an observed system is often usefully described by a<br/>number of hidden (or latent) factors.  Given a sequence of<br/>observations, the task is to infer which latent factors are active at<br/>each time frame.  In this talk I will describe the application of a<br/>switching linear dynamical model to monitoring the condition<br/>of a patient receiving intensive care.  The state of health of<br/>a patient cannot be observed directly, but different underlying factors<br/>are associated with particular patterns of measurements, e.g. in the<br/>heart rate, blood pressure and temperature. </p><p>I will describe two recent developments for this framework&#58; <br/>1) A Hierarchical Switching Linear Dynamical System (HSLDS) has been<br/>developed for the detection of sepsis in neonates in an intensive care<br/>unit (ICU). This adds a higher-level discrete switch variable with<br/>semantics sepsis/non-sepsis above the factors in the Factorial<br/>Switching LDS (FSLDS) of Quinn et al.  (2009).</p><p>2) The FSLDS is a generative model for the observations.  We present a<br/>Discriminative Switching Linear Dynamical System (DSLDS) applied to<br/>patient monitoring in ICUs. Our approach is based on identifying the<br/>state-of-health of a patient given their observed vital signs using a<br/>discriminative classifier, and then inferring their underlying<br/>physiological values conditioned on this status.  We demonstrate on<br/>two real-world datasets that the DSLDS is able to outperform the FSLDS<br/>in most cases of interest, and that a combination of the two models<br/>achieves higher performance than either of the two models<br/>separately.</p><p>Joint work with Yvonne Freer, Konstantinos Georgatzis, Ioan Stanculescu</p><p>Speaker Bio&#58;</p><p>Chris Williams is Professor of Machine Learning in the School of<br/>Informatics, University of Edinburgh. He is interested in a wide range<br/>of theoretical and practical issues in machine learning, statistical<br/>pattern recognition, probabilistic graphical models and computer<br/>vision. This includes theoretical foundations, the development of new<br/>models and algorithms, and applications. His main areas of research<br/>are in visual object recognition and image understanding, <br/>models for understanding time-series, unsupervised learning, and<br/>Gaussian processes.</p><p>He obtained his MSc (1990) and PhD (1994) at the University of<br/>Toronto, under the supervision of Geoff Hinton.  He was a member of<br/>the Neural Computing Research Group at Aston University from 1994 to<br/>1998, and has been at the University of Edinburgh since 1998. He was<br/>program co-chair of NIPS in 2009, and is on the editorial boards of<br/>the Journal of Machine Learning Research and Proceedings of the Royal<br/>Society A.</p><p>http&#58;//homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ckiw/</p>
