title: Learning from Temporal Data Using Dynamical Feature Space
summary: <p>In learning from "static" data (order of data presentation does not carry any useful information), one framework for dealing with such data is to transform the input items non-linearly into a feature space (usually high-dimensional), that is "rich" enough, so that linear techniques are sufficient. However, data such as EEG signals, or biological sequences naturally comes with a sequential structure. I will present a general dynamical filter that effectively acts as a dynamical feature space for representing temporally ordered samples. I will then outline a framework for learning on sets of sequential data by building kernels based such temporal filters. The methodology will be demonstrated in a series of sequence classification tasks and in an incremental temporal "regime" detection task. </p>
