title: Non- and semi-parametric construction of stationary dependent models
summary: <p>In this talk we present a procedure to constructing stationary dependent models based on latent probability measures. The idea focuses in developing first-order dependent models from particular conditional independence structures. We address the idea with the introduction of a fully non-parametric Markov model in discrete time, as well with some other extensions incorporating exogenous interventions and multivariate versions in a semi-parametric setting. We also sketch some ideas to perform inference and predictions within the Bayesian framework.</p><p>(Joint work with Stephen G. Walker, U.
