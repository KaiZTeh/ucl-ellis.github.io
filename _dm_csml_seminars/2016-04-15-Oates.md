title: Stein Operators on Hilbert Spaces
summary: <p>In 1972, Charles Stein published a central limit theorem for correlated variables. The mathematical approach used in the proof has since become known as Stein’s Method. This talk provides an introduction to Stein’s Method and describes a formal generalisation, based on Stein Operators. A characterisation of the action of Stein Operators on Hilbert spaces offers considerable potential for applications in kernel-based machine learning. One such application is presented, in the context of numerical integration for Bayesian posterior computation.</p><p><a href="http&#58;//oates.work/">Speaker website</a></p>
