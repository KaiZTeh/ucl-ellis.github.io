title: Learning with random projections
summary: <p>Abstract&#58; Since the impressive advances in the area of compressed<br/>sensing, dimensionality reduction by random projections for machine<br/>learning and data mining gains a renewed interest. In direct analogy,<br/>compressive learning means to carry out learning tasks efficiently on<br/>cheaply compressed versions of high dimensional massive data sets that<br/>have a sparse representation. This talk will discuss conditions and<br/>guarantees for compressive learning to succeed, which do not require<br/>the data to have a sparse representation but instead exploit the<br/>natural structure of the learning problem. In particular, we give<br/>tight risk bounds in classification and regression settings, which<br/>have a clear interpretation and reveal meaningful structural<br/>properties of the problem that make it solvable effectively in a small<br/>dimensional random subspace. We will also demonstrate that performance<br/>gains are achievable by combining several compressive learners into an<br/>ensemble.</p><p>Speaker Bio&#58; Dr. Ata Kaban is currently senior lecturer in Computer Science at the<br/>University of Birmingham. She recieved her PhD in Computer Science from the<br/>University of Paisley, supervised by Mark Girolami. She also holds a PhD in<br/>Musicology. Her research interests are&#58; statistical machine learning, data<br/>mining - with emphasis on high dimensional data spaces; algorithmic learning<br/>theory; probabilistic modelling of data, and Bayesian inference; high<br/>dimensional phenomena, measure concentration, random matrix theory;<br/>dimensionality reduction, random projections; large-scale heuristic<br/>black-box optimisation.</p><p>Speaker's Webpage&#58; http&#58;//www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~axk/</p><p>Slides for the talk&#58; <a href="http&#58;//events.csml.ucl.ac.uk/userdata/lunch_talks/AtaKaban_UCLtalk.pdf">PDF</a></p><p>Video of the talk <a href="http&#58;//www.csml.ucl.ac.uk/userdata/lunch_talks/videos/CSML_Seminars_2014-11-14.html">here</a>.</p>
