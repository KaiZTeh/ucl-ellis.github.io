title: A Continuous-Time View of Early Stopping for Least Squares
summary: We study the statistical properties of the iterates generated by gradient descent, applied to the fundamental problem of least squares regression. We take a continuous-time view, i.e., consider infinitesimal step sizes in gradient descent, in which case the iterates form a trajectory called gradient flow. Our primary focus is to compare the risk of gradient flow to that of ridge regression. Under the calibration t=1/λ---where t is the time parameter in gradient flow, and λ the tuning parameter in ridge regression---we prove that the risk of gradient flow is no less than 1.69 times that of ridge, along the entire path (for all t≥0). This holds in finite samples with very weak assumptions on the data model (in particular, with no assumptions on the features X).
