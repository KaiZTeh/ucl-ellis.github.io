title: Tutorial on Deep RL
summary: <p>Deep reinforcement learning is one of the hottest topics in machine learning research, and is thought to be a plausible route to Artificial General Intelligence. The idea behind this is that reinforcement learning is a formal way of training goal-directed agents, and can be combined with deep learning to train agents directly from raw, high-dimensional data. In this talk I will go through a quick introduction to deep learning and reinforcement learning, to then focus on the deep Q-network for playing Atari video games, as well as the asynchronous advantage actor-critic algorithm. To finish off I will discuss more specific topics of research in deep reinforcement learning, highlighting the broad spectrum of work to still be done.</p>
