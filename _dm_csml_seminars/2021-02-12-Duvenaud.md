title: Latent Stochastic Differential Equations&#58; An Unexplored Model Class.
summary: <p>Abstract&#58; We show how to do gradient-based stochastic variational inference in stochastic differential equations (SDEs), in a way that allows the use of adaptive SDE solvers.  This allows us to scalably fit a new family of richly-parameterized distributions over irregularly-sampled time series.  We apply latent SDEs to motion capture data, and to demonstrate infinitely-deep Bayesian neural networks.  We also discuss the pros and cons of this barely-explored model class, comparing it to Gaussian processes and neural processes.</p><p>Some technical details are in this paper&#58; https&#58;//arxiv.org/abs/2001.01328<br/>And code is available at&#58; https&#58;//github.com/google-research/torchsde</p><p>Bio&#58; David Duvenaud is an assistant professor in computer science at the University of Toronto. His research focuses on continuous-time models, latent-variable models, and deep learning.  His postdoc was done at Harvard University, and his Ph.D. at the University of Cambridge.  David also co-founded Invenia, an energy forecasting company.</p>
