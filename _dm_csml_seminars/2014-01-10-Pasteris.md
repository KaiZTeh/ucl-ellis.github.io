title: Online Similarity Prediction of Networked Data
summary: <p>We consider online similarity prediction problems over networked<br/>data. We begin by relating this task to the more standard class prediction<br/>problem, showing that, given an arbitrary algorithm for class prediction,<br/>we can construct an algorithm for similarity prediction with "nearly" the<br/>same mistake bound, and vice versa. After noticing that this general<br/>construction is computationally infeasible, we target our study to<br/>feasible similarity prediction algorithms on networked data. We initially<br/>assume that the network structure is known to the learner. Here we<br/>observe that Matrix Winnow has a near-optimal mistake guarantee,<br/>at the price of cubic prediction time per round. This motivates our effort<br/>for an efficient implementation of a Perceptron algorithm with a weaker<br/>mistake guarantee but with only poly-logarithmic prediction time. Our focus<br/>then turns to the challenging case of networks whose structure is initially<br/>unknown to the learner. In this novel setting, where the network<br/>structure is only incrementally revealed, we obtain a mistake-bounded<br/>algorithm with a quadratic prediction time per round.</p>
