title: Probabilistic Independence, Graphs, and Random Networks
summary: <p>The main purpose of this talk is to explore the relationship between the set of conditional independence statements induced by a probability distribution and the set of separations induced by graphs as studied in graphical models. I introduce the concepts of Markov property and faithfulness, and provide conditions under which a given probability distribution is Markov or faithful to a graph in a general setting. I discuss the implications of these conditions in devising structural learning algorithms, in understanding exchangeable vectors, and in random network analysis.</p>
