title: Investigating the Emergence of Cooperative Behaviour for Artificial Societies with RL
summary: <p>The human ability to coordinate and cooperate has been vital to the development of societies for thousands of years, yet it is not fully clear how this behaviour arises. Mathematical and computational models have been used to get insights especially with respect to the underlying individual decision-making mechanisms.</p><p>In this talk I will discuss our current work on the emergence of cooperation in societies using Reinforcement Learning and social dilemma environments that highlight the tensions between individual goals and the collective interests of a group. In particular we explore social norms and how the success of norms may be attributed to certain dynamics that are key to developing cooperative behaviour. I will present our initial findings and outline the open challenges in this area.</p><p>https&#58;//arxiv.org/abs/1902.03185</p><p>https&#58;//arxiv.org/abs/1809.10007<br/></p>
