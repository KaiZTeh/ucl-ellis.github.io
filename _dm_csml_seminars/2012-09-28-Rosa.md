title:  Machine learning approaches for clinical neuroimaging data
summary: <p>Our group is interested in developing mathematical models and tools for<br/>the application of novel machine learning techniques to the analysis of<br/>brain imaging data. We focus on the diagnosis and prognosis of psychiatric<br/>disorders and on understanding affective processing in normal and patients<br/>groups. In this talk we will describe the machine-learning framework we<br/>use for pattern recognition analysis of neuroimaging data. We will<br/>introduce the relevant clinical questions that can be addressed with this<br/>framework and briefly describe our current methodological developments to<br/>investigate these questions, such as new feature selection, multivariate<br/>brain mapping and generative embedding approaches. We will also present<br/>our recently developed software&#58; <a href="http&#58;//www.mlnl.cs.ucl.ac.uk/pronto/">Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging<br/>Toolbox, aka PRoNTo</a>.</p><p>Slides for the talk&#58; <a href="/userdata/lunch_talks/2012_09_28_jm_1.pdf">Part 1</a>, <a href="/userdata/lunch_talks/2012_09_28_jm_2.pdf">Part 2</a>, <a href="/userdata/lunch_talks/2012_09_28_jm_3.pdf">Part 3</a></p>
