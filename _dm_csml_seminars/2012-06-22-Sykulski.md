title: Statistical modelling and estimation of physical phenomena in ocean surface trajectories
summary: <p>We have a large data set from 10,000 or so floating devices which drift around the Earth's oceans. Summarising these 'ocean surface trajectoriesâ€™ is best done using time series analysis. In this talk we provide a general introduction to time series analysis, with a focus on complex-valued time series and spectral domain analysis - which is particularly useful for ocean data (and indeed many other applications). We then construct a semi-parametric statistical model for ocean surface trajectories which is composed of a combination of stochastic processes. We demonstrate the usefulness of our model in terms of detecting and summarising changes in the behaviour of the data - which helps the oceanographers understand how the movement of oceans change over time and space.</p><p>Slides for the talk&#58; <a href="/userdata/lunch_talks/2012_06_22_as.pdf">PDF</a></p>
