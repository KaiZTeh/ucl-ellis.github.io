title: Diffusion modelling of motion trajectories under the inï¬‚uence of covariates
summary: <p>We present dynamic spatial modelling and computational<br/>methods for the analysis of collections of objects moving in a<br/>spatially inhomogeneous force field under the influence of covariates.<br/>Core motivating examples come from movement ecology and cell motility,<br/>where multiple animals are tracked moving in 2-D or 3-D largely driven<br/>by the external environmental characteristics. Interest lies in<br/>identifying the role of different covariates in guiding the motion,<br/>both in terms of the shape of their implied field, as well as their<br/>overall presence or absence of influence. Models are based on<br/>discrete-time, dynamic state-space models for locations and<br/>directional velocities of each of a set of animals, combined with a<br/>latent force-field over the temporal domain that drives changes in<br/>velocities. We extend models for the force fields using dynamic<br/>Bayesian radial basis function regression to define a potential<br/>surface varying in space but also in the space of covariates, with the<br/>force field given by the gradient of the potential in 3-D.<br/>Corresponding variable selection priors allow us to detect which<br/>covariates play a role in shaping the motion, and provide a basis for<br/>understanding their precise functional form. We exemplify the work on<br/>two examples&#58; a 3-D dataset from in-vivo immune cell motility, and a<br/>GPS tracking dataset from toucans in central America.</p><p>Slides for the talk&#58; <a href="http&#58;//events.csml.ucl.ac.uk/userdata/lunch_talks/CSMLlunchIoanna.pdf">PDF</a></p>
