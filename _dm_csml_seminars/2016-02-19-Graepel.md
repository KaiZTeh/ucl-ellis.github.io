title: DeepMind's Quest for Artificial General Intelligence&#58; From Atari to AlphaGo and beyond
summary: <p>Abstract [NOTE slight change in the program]&#58;<br/>Thore will giving an overview of the ambitious research program at DeepMind, including some of our latest advances. I will also discuss some of the key challenges we are currently tackling in the quest to build Artificial General Intelligence, and the approaches we are taking to solve them. One example will be our new approach to computer Go that combines Monte-Carlo tree search with deep neural networks resulting in AlphaGo, the first computer program to defeat a human professional Go player.</p><p>Bio&#58;<br/>Thore Graepel is a senior researcher at Google DeepMind and an affiliated professor in Machine Learning at University College London. He is broadly interested in understanding intelligence and building it into general artificial systems. Throughout his career, he has had many outstanding contributions to the field of machine learning &amp; probabilistic modelling -- most prominently in areas of recommender and ranking systems, social analytics, probabilistic programming, online advertising and development of game AI-s. He was previously a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge and head of the research group on Online Services and Advertising. Before joining Microsoft, he received his PhD from TU Berlin and conducted post-doctoral research at ETH Zurich and Royal Holloway, University of London.<br/></p>
