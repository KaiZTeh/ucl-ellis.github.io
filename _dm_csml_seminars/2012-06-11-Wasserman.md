speaker: Larry Wasserman
affiliation: Carnegie Mellon University
title: Discussion
summary: <p>A great opportunity to interact closely with a researcher of such a caliber  as Larry and ask him lots of questions. Since he is already giving various talks and lectures there will be no talk just lunch so prepare the questions you would like to ask. We are giving you a heads up now so you have time to prepare and maybe read about his current research. We will send another email once we are closer to the date. Looking forward to see you all there.</p>
