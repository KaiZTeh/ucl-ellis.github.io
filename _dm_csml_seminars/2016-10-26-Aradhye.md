title: Personalized app/games recommendations on Google Play using machine learning
summary: <p>This informal, loosely technical talk will give a quick overview of personalization and discovery on the Play Store and our recent achievements and focus. Google Play is one of the most used mobile applications today with over one billion active users. We are actively engaged with research collaborations towards better personalized recommendations using scalable machine learning. I will briefly discuss a new ML paradigm called 'Wide &amp; Deep learning'—jointly trained wide linear models and deep neural networks—to combine the benefits of memorization and generalization for recommender systems. Online experiment results show that Wide &amp; Deep significantly increased app acquisitions compared with wide-only and deep-only models. </p>
