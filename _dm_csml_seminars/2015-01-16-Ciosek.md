title: Combining state abstraction and temporal abstraction in MDP solving
summary: <p>The talk presents a way of solving Markov Decision Processes that<br/>combines state abstraction and temporal abstraction. Specifically, we<br/>combine state aggregation with the options framework and demonstrate<br/>that they work well together and indeed it is only after one combines<br/>the two that the full benefit of each is realized. We introduce a<br/>hierarchical value iteration algorithm where we first coarsely solve<br/>subgoals and then use these approximate solutions to exactly solve the<br/>MDP. This algorithm solves several problems faster than vanilla value<br/>iteration.</p><p>About the speaker&#58; Kamil Ciosek (ciosek.net) is a PhD student at CSML specialising in approximate approaches to solving MDPs.</p>
