title: Two generic principles in modern bandits&#58; the optimistic principle and Thompson sampling
summary: <p>Abstract&#58; I will describe two principles considered in multi-armed bandits, namely the optimistic principle and Thompson sampling, and illustrate how they extend to structured bandit settings, such as in linear bandits and bandits in graphs.</p><p>Bio&#58; Remi Munos received his PhD in 1997 in Cognitive Science from EHESS, France, and did a postdoc at CMU from 1998-2000. Then he was Assistant Professor in the department of Applied Mathematics at Ecole Polytechnique. In 2006 he joined the French public research institute INRIA as a Senior Researcher and co-leaded the project-team SequeL (Sequential Learning) which now gather approximately 25 people. His research interests cover several fields of Statistical Learning including Reinforcement Learning, Optimization, and Bandit Theory.</p><p>Slides for the talk&#58; <a href="http&#58;//events.csml.ucl.ac.uk/userdata/lunch_talks/RemiMunos.pdf">PDF</a></p>
