title: (Deep-ish) SLAM for Next Generation AR
summary: <p>I will be talking about the three main components of next-gen AR that the Active Vision Lab and 6D.ai are working on. First is dense 3D geometric reconstruction from depth, stereo and mono, where I will present some of our work towards hyper-real time 3D fusion, our latest GA-Net framework for stereo matching (CVPR 2019, oral) and show several demos. Next, I will talk about the AR Cloud, and the various methods we've developed for geometric relocalisation, including our RelocNet system (ECCV 2018 oral) and Grove (CVPR 2018 oral, T-PAMI 2019). Finally, I will talk about semantic 3D reconstruction, and, among others, showcase our upcoming work on very fast instance segmentation, Mobile RCNN.<br/></p>
