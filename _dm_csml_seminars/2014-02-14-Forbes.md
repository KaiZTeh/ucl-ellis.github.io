title: Quantifying Fingerprint Evidence using Bayesian Alignment
summary: <p>Fingerprint evidence has long been considered infallible by courtrooms<br/>worldwide. However, subjective human judgement plays a large role in<br/>determining whether or not two fingerprints match, especially when<br/>dealing with the blurry prints typical of crime scenes. Despite this<br/>uncertainty, courtroom fingerprint evidence is always presented<br/>categorically as a match or non-match. This leads to inflated<br/>confidence in the forensic evidence, and sometimes to false<br/>convictions.  These false convictions have instigated a push within<br/>the forensics community to present courtroom evidence as a likelihood<br/>ratio€  rather than a categorical match. Before this is possible, a<br/>standardized method for quantifying the strength of fingerprint<br/>evidence needs to be developed.  I am developing a Bayesian<br/>hierarchical model where the feature points of fingerprints (called<br/>minutiae) are represented using spatial Poisson point processes.</p><p>Determining how well two fingerprints match reduces to identifying a<br/>matching (a bipartite graph which determines which minutiae are common<br/>to both fingerprints), and a rigid motion between the fingerprint<br/>images such that the common minutiae are spatially close.  An MCMC<br/>algorithm has been developed to sum over all possible matchings and<br/>rigid motions to determine the likelihood ratio between the<br/>prosecution hypothesis (the two observed fingerprints originate from<br/>the same finger) and the defense hypothesis (the two observed<br/>fingerprints originate from independent fingers).  The model has been<br/>tested on a small database of 258 forensic fingerprints provided by<br/>the American Forensic Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>Joint work with Steffen Lauritzen (Oxford) and Jesper Møller (Aalborg).</p><p>Slides for the talk&#58; <a href="http&#58;//events.csml.ucl.ac.uk/userdata/lunch_talks/ForbesUCL.pdf">PDF</a></p>
