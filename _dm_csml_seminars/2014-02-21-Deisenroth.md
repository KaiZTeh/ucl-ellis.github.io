title: Statistical Machine Learning for Autonomous Systems
summary: <p>Autonomous learning has been a promising direction in control and<br/>robotics for more than a decade since learning models and controllers<br/>from data allows us to reduce the amount of engineering knowledge that<br/>is otherwise required.  Due to their flexibility, autonomous<br/>reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically require many<br/>interactions with the system to learn controllers. However, in real<br/>systems, such as robots, many interactions can be impractical and time<br/>consuming. To address this problem, current learning approaches<br/>typically require task-specific knowledge in form of expert<br/>demonstrations, pre-shaped policies, or specific knowledge about the<br/>underlying dynamics.</p><p>In the first part of the talk, we follow a different approach and speed<br/>up learning by efficiently extracting information from sparse data. In<br/>particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian process<br/>dynamics model. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty into<br/>long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the<br/>effects of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning. Compared<br/>to state-of-the art RL our model-based policy search method achieves<br/>an unprecedented speed of learning. We demonstrate its applicability to<br/>autonomous learning in real robot and control tasks.</p><p>In the second part of my talk, we will discuss an alternative method for<br/>learning controllers based on Bayesian Optimization, where it is no<br/>longer possible to learn models of the underlying dynamics. We<br/>successfully applied Bayesian optimization to learning controller<br/>parameters for a bipedal robot, where modeling the dynamics is very<br/>difficult due to ground contacts. Using Bayesian optimization, we<br/>sidestep this modeling issue and directly optimize the controller<br/>parameters without the need of modeling the robot's dynamics.</p>
