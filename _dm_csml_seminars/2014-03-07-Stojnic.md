title: Bayesian Molecular LEGO
summary: <p>The assembly of cellular components has been traditionally modelled using differential equations. In this work I will present a new formalism that yields a model similar to Bayesian Networks where every node represents one molecule. The intuition behind the model can be captured with an analogy to LEGO building blocks where blocks (=molecules) are successively added to create the final molecular structure. I will show that the structure can be reverse-engineered from measurements of molecular abundance under perturbation. I will discuss the Bayesian approach to structure inference, and derive an efficient maximum a-posteriori inference scheme with uniform priors. I will discuss how the choice of prior has crucial influence on the success of inference.</p>
