title: A Population Approach to Ubicomp System Design (APAUSD)
summary: <p>The emergence of the “app store” market as a way to distribute software applications for mobile devices has provided a means for researchers to run worldwide trials of ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) applications with very large numbers of users. The state of the app, the action of the user, and any contextual information the phone can detect, are all values that can be timestamped, logged, and used for analysis. The APAUSD project is a collaboration between UCL and Glasgow University, and aims to utilise this abundance of new information to develop analysis tools that will hopefully aid in the design of future software. UCL’s role in the project is to develop statistical models admitting a natural extension to the domain of application. In this talk I will discuss ongoing work within the project and the related ideas that make the future work so exciting. The talk will be low in mathematical content and should appeal to a wide CSML audience.</p><p>Slides for the talk&#58; <a href="http&#58;//events.csml.ucl.ac.uk/userdata/lunch_talks/2013_02_22_mh.pdf">PDF</a></p>
