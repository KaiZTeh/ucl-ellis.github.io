summary: <p>Abstract&#58;</p><p>Founded in 2011 in London, Google DeepMind is a unique environment for<br/>long-term ambitious research to flourish in. This talk will share how their<br/>world-class interdisciplinary team has made a number of high profile<br/>breakthroughs towards general AI by combining the best techniques from deep<br/>learning, reinforcement learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful<br/>general-purpose learning algorithms.</p><p>Bio&#58;</p><p>Demis Hassabis is a neuroscientist and leading expert on the neural basis<br/>of memory and imagination. He is the Founder/CEO of DeepMind Technologies<br/>which was recently acquired by Google. Demis was a former child chess<br/>prodigy, who finished his A-levels early at 16 before going on to co-create<br/>the multi-million selling video game Theme Park for Bullfrog Productions.<br/>Upon graduating from Cambridge University with a Double First in Computer<br/>Science he founded the high-profile video games company Elixir Studios,<br/>which he grew to 60 people, producing pioneering games for Microsoft and<br/>Vivendi Universal. After successfully selling the IP and technology rights,<br/>Demis returned to academia to complete a PhD in cognitive neuroscience at<br/>UCL, focusing on the hippocampus and amnesia. His research systematically<br/>connecting memory with imagination for the first time was listed in the top<br/>ten scientific breakthroughs of 2007 by the journal Science. Subsequently<br/>he was a visiting scientist jointly at MIT and Harvard, before securing a<br/>Sir Henry Wellcome Fellowship as a Research Fellow at the Gatsby<br/>Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL.</p>
