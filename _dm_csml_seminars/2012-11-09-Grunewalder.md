title: Conditional Expectation Estimates for Discrete Control
summary: <p>I will talk about estimates of conditional expectations and their application to control problems in discrete time and space. I will show empirical performance of the approach and will sketch a proof of convergence to the best possible strategy. If time permits, I will discuss the discrete time and continuous space setting and show how the proof can be extended to this case.<br/> <br/>Joint work with Guy Lever, Luca Baldassarre, Massi Pontil &amp; Arthur Gretton.</p>
