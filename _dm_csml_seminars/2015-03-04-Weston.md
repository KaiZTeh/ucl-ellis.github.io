title: Memory Networks
summary: <p>We describe a new class of learning models called memory networks. Memory networks reason with inference components combined with a long-term memory component; they learn how to use these jointly. The long-term memory can be read and written to, with the goal of using it for prediction. We investigate these models in the context of question answering (QA) where the long-term memory effectively acts as a (dynamic) knowledge base, and the output is a textual response. We evaluate them on a large-scale QA task, and a set of smaller, but more complex, toy tasks generated from a simulated world. In the latter, we show the reasoning power of such models by chaining multiple supporting sentences to answer questions that require understanding the intension of verbs.</p><p>This is joint work with Sumit Chopra, Antoine Bordes and Tomas Mikolov.</p><p>About the speaker&#58;</p><p>Jason Weston is a research scientist at Facebook, NY since February 2014. He earned his PhD in machine learning at Royal Holloway, University of London and at AT&amp;T Research in Red Bank, NJ (advisors&#58; Alex Gammerman, Volodya Vovk and Vladimir Vapnik) in 2000. From 2000 to 2002, he was a researcher at Biowulf technologies, New York. From 2002 to 2003 he was a research scientist at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tuebingen, Germany. From 2003 to 2009 he was a research staff member at NEC Labs America, Princeton.  From 2009 to 2014 he was a research scientist at Google, NY. His interests lie in statistical machine learning and its application to text and images. Jason has published over 90 papers, including best paper awards at ICML and ECML. He was also part of the YouTube team that won a National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences Emmy Award for Technology and Engineering for Personalized Recommendation Engines for Video Discovery.</p>
