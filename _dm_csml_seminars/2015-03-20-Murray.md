title: Flexible and deep models for density estimation
summary: <p>We bring the empirical success of deep neural network models in<br/>regression and classification to high-dimensional density estimation.<br/>Using the product rule, density estimation in D-dimensions can be<br/>reduced to D regression tasks. We tie these tasks together to improve<br/>computational and statistical efficiency, obtaining state-of-the-art<br/>fits across a wide range of benchmark tasks. I'll give an example<br/>Bayesian data analysis application from cosmology.</p><p><a href="http&#58;//homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/">Speaker website</a></p><p>Work with <a href="http&#58;//homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/pub/13rnade/">Benigno Uria</a> and <a href="http&#58;//homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/imurray2/pub/14dnade/">Hugo Larochelle</a>.<br/></p>
