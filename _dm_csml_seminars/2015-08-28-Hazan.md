title: Classification with Low Rank and Missing Data
summary: <p>We consider classification and regression tasks where we have missing<br/>data and assume that the (clean) data resides in a low rank subspace.<br/>We describe an efficient algorithm with provable guarantees for this<br/>setting, as well as a general technique for circumventing<br/>computational hardness via non-reconstructive learning.</p><p>based on joint work with Roi Livni and Yishay Mansour</p><p>bio&#58;<br/>Elad Hazan is researching the automation of the mechanism of<br/>learning and its efficient algorithmic implementation.  He is a member<br/>of the faculty of Princeton University, department of computer<br/>science.<br/></p>
