title: Principled Non-Linear Feature Selection (with applications in representation learning)
summary: <p>Following recent work in non-linear feature selection we propose a novel method for assessing the contribution of <br/>a feature through estimating its expected impact on the alignment or HSIC measure. Theoretical analysis of this <br/>approach is included showing that for appropriate polynomial sample sizes influential features can be distinguished <br/>from irrelevant ones. We present experimental evidence which confirm the analysis including applications in representation learning. <br/>The method was used to obtain a 3rd position result in the 2013 ICML black box learning challenge, as well as competitive results in <br/>signal peptide prediction, an important bioinformatics application. </p>
