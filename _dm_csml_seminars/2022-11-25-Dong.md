title: On the stability of spectral graph filters and beyond
summary: "Data collected in network domains, hence supported by an irregular graph rather than a regular grid-like structure, are becoming pervasive. Typical examples include gene expression data associated with a protein-protein interaction graph, or behaviours of a group of individuals in a social network. Graph-based signal processing and machine learning are recent techniques that have been developed to handle such graph-structured data and have seen applications in such diverse fields as drug discovery, fake news detection, and traffic prediction. However, a theoretical understanding of the robustness of these models against perturbation to the input graph domain has been lacking. In this talk, I will present our results on the stability bounds of spectral graph filters as well as other recent work on the robustness of graph machine learning models, which together will contribute to the deployment of these models in real-world scenarios."
bio: "Xiaowen Dong is an Associate Professor in the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford, where he is an academic member of both the Machine Learning Research Group and the Oxford-Man Institute. Prior to joining Oxford, he was a postdoctoral associate in the MIT Media Lab, where he remains as a research affiliate, and received his PhD degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland. His main research interests concern signal processing and machine learning techniques for analysing network data, and their applications in studying questions across social and economic sciences."
