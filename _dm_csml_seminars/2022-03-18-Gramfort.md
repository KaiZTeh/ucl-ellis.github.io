title: Machine Learning without human supervision on neuroscience signals
summary: The revolution of artificial intelligence over the last decade has been made possible by statistical machine learning, and in particular by supervised learning where algorithms are given the labels associated with each observation. Although very efficient, this approach faces several difficulties in a neuroscience and more broadly in a medical context; one needs enough labels, one needs good labels, and sometimes simply defining what are the labels is problematic... While pure unsupervised learning can be tempting it leads to other kinds of difficulties, namely model selection, validation and results interpretation which is often challenging beyond computer vision and natural language processing. In my presentation, I will discuss recent strategies we have explored in my team to bring AI and neuroscience together by leveraging large EEG and fMRI datasets and without relying on tedious or costly human annotations. I will first present how self-supervised learning allows to reveal structures in EEG data [1], before explaining how fMRI and pretained language models can help us decipher language processing in the brain [2, 3]. Finally I will present how old ideas from latent factor models with independence assumptions can help us make sense of neuroimaging data collected when subjects are exposed to uncontroled naturalistic stimuli [4,5].
