title: Predictor Variable Prioritization in Nonlinear Models&#58; A Genetic Association Case Study
summary: <p>Title&#58; "Predictor Variable Prioritization in Nonlinear Models&#58; A<br/>Genetic Association Case Study"</p><p>Abstract&#58;<br/>We address variable selection questions in nonlinear and nonparametric<br/>regression. Motivated by statistical genetics, where nonlinear<br/>interactions are of particular interest, we introduce a novel,<br/>interpretable, and computationally efficient way to summarize the<br/>relative importance of predictor variables. Methodologically, we<br/>develop the “RelATive cEntrality” (RATE) measure to prioritize<br/>candidate genetic variants that are not just marginally important, but<br/>whose associations also stem from significant covarying relationships<br/>with other variants in the data. We illustrate RATE through Bayesian<br/>Gaussian process regression, but the methodological innovations apply<br/>to other nonlinear methods. It is known that nonlinear models often<br/>exhibit greater predictive accuracy than linear models, particularly<br/>for phenotypes generated by complex genetic architectures. With<br/>detailed simulations and an Arabidopsis thaliana QTL mapping study, we<br/>show that applying RATE enables an explanation for this improved<br/>performance.</p><p>Bio&#58;<br/>Seth Flaxman is a lecturer in the statistics section of the<br/>Department of Mathematics at Imperial College London, joint with the<br/>Data Science Institute. His research is on scalable methods and<br/>flexible models for spatiotemporal statistics and Bayesian machine<br/>learning, applied to public policy and social science. He has worked<br/>on application areas that include public health, crime, voting<br/>patterns, filter bubbles / echo chambers in media, the regulation of<br/>machine learning algorithms, and emotion.</p>
