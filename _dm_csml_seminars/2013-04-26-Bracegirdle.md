title: Probabilistic Inference for Changepoints and Cointegration
summary: <p>In this talk I will present my PhD work - first on Bayesian generative models for time-series with changepoints, showing the complexity of exact inference. Second, I will describe work on cointegrated time series, including an approach to estimating the regression coefficients of cointegrated series based on a Bayesian generative model, which seeks to overcome the bias of the traditional OLS estimator for these non-stationary series. I show how the cointegration model can be effective for detecting simple cointegration between series and moreover, by application of changepoint inference, also for intermittent cointegration - allowing for periods when cointegration is "switched off".</p><p>Slides for the talk&#58; <a href="http&#58;//events.csml.ucl.ac.uk/userdata/lunch_talks/2013_04_26_cb.pdf">PDF</a></p>
