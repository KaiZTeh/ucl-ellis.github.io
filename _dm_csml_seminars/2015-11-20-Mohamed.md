title: Memory-based Bayesian Reasoning with Deep Learning
summary: <p>Deep learning and Bayesian machine learning are currently two of the most<br/>active areas of machine learning research. Deep learning provides a<br/>powerful class of models and an easy framework for learning that now<br/>provides state-of-the-art methods for applications ranging from image<br/>classification to speech recognition. Bayesian reasoning provides a<br/>powerful approach for knowledge integration, inference, and decision making<br/>that has established it as the key tool for data-efficient learning,<br/>uncertainty quantification and robust model composition, widely-used in<br/>applications ranging from information retrieval to large-scale ranking.<br/>Each of these research areas has shortcomings that can be effectively<br/>addressed by the other, pointing towards a needed convergence of these two<br/>areas of machine learning, and that enhances our machine learning practice.</p><p>One powerful outcome of this convergence is our ability to develop systems<br/>for probabilistic inference with memory. A memory-based inference amortises<br/>the cost of probabilistic reasoning by cleverly reusing prior computations.<br/>To explore this, we shall take a statistical tour of deep learning,<br/>re-examine latent variable models and approximate Bayesian inference, and<br/>make connections to denoising auto-encoders and other stochastic<br/>encoder-decoder systems. In this way, we will make sense of what memory in<br/>inference might mean, and highlight the use of amortised inference in many<br/>other parts of machine learning.</p><p>---- Bio ----<br/>Shakir's research focuses on exploring and incorporating probabilistic<br/>reasoning in all aspects of machine learning, towards the goal of building<br/>principled, scalable and general-purpose probabilistic decision-making<br/>systems. His current research interests lie at the intersection of<br/>variational inference, deep learning and reinforcement learning. Shakir is<br/>a senior research scientist at Google DeepMind in London. Before moving to<br/>London, he held a junior research fellowship from the Canadian Institute<br/>for Advanced Research (CIFAR) as part of the programme on Neural<br/>Computation and Adaptive Perception, at the University of British Columbia<br/>with Nando de Freitas. He completed his PhD with Zoubin Ghahramani at the<br/>University of Cambridge, as a Commonwealth Scholar to the United Kingdom<br/>and a member of St John's College. He is from South Africa, and completed<br/>his prior degrees in Electrical and Information Engineering at the<br/>University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.</p>
