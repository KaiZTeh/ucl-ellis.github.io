title: Series Expansion Methods for Approximate Learning, Filtering and Smoothing in Diffusions
summary: <p>Many systems in science, engineering and finance are described using<br/>known forms of parameterised differential equations. Often there are<br/>unknown random influences to such systems and so a stochastic<br/>differential system is an appropriate model. However inference and<br/>learning in general nonlinear stochastic differential systems is<br/>notoriously hard, primarily because the finite time transition<br/>probability cannot be explicitly represented.</p><p>I will discuss the series expansion approach for approximating a<br/>diffusion, and demonstrate examples of the method in direct<br/>application for parameter estimation in diffusion processes, and via<br/>nonlinear Kalman filters and the unscented particle filter.</p><p>This talk describes joint work with Simon Lyons and Simo Sarkka, and was funded by a MSR Cambridge PhD fellowship.</p><p>Bio&#58;</p><p>Amos Storkey is a reader (associate professor) at the School of Informatics, Edinburgh University. He did his PhD in Neural Networks at the Neural Systems Group, Imperial College, London. His research interests include&#58; machine learning markets; Bayesian methods for brain imaging; continuous time/depth systems; dynamical Boltzmann machine models; scalable deep learning.</p><p>Video of the talk <a href="http&#58;//www.csml.ucl.ac.uk/userdata/lunch_talks/videos/CSML_Seminars_2014-11-21.html">here</a>.</p>
